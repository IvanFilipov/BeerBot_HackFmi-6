The idea : 

Our team will create a BeerBot - "Alexander Chewbalski" , which purpose is to measure the temperature of a beer, when a bottle is placed in the stand (by infrared thermometer) in order to show it on the LCD screen and make a decision: if the beer is cold enough, the BeerBot with "pleasure" will help the user by using a special mechanism (power given via a reductor) with which to open it, but if the beer is warm, its opening would be beneath the dignity of the BeerBot - so it provides the user a beer opener (by activating a mechanism that opens a drawer). Thus making the user rethink - will he open it, or see the error in his ways.

The team :

The BeerBot is called after engineer Alexandur Filipov and Nikolay Petrov for giving us a hand with 
mechanical problems.
